# reblack
Designed to be easy to pick up, reblack is lightning fast and darkeningly stealthy.

## Features
reblack isn't your run of the mill proxy site (well it kind of is but it's unique). reblack is designed with the needs of most of it's users. Here's what's in the package
- A simple search tool, using DuckDuckGo. It also has a variety of web proxy backends, allowing you to choose between our in-house solution blackHole, the reliable Ultraviolet, and the new, fast Scramjet for your browsing.
- A highly customizable, JSON based "arcade," with many games you can find online, or add more with a streamlined, repeatable setup!
- Easily themable, including many themes to change the reblack experience, some of which can cloak the site to look just like some sites.
- reblack is safe to use, as in case anybody monitors you, it is easy to press a single key to load a site of your choosing on the proxy.
- reblack can be used as a portable folder, run locally on the system. This is faster and designed to circumvent conventional blocks, but still can be detected on some GoGuardian and LanSchool setups.
